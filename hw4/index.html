			<h2>Part 1: Masses and Springs</h2>
			<p>
				In this part, I implemented a cloth simulation using a system of point masses and springs. 
				The implementation creates a grid of masses connected by three types of springs: structural 
				constraints (connecting adjacent masses), shearing constraints (connecting diagonal masses), 
				and bending constraints (connecting masses that are two positions apart).
			</p>

			<!-- Part 2 -->
			<h2>Part 2: Simulation Parameters</h2>
			<p>
				In this part, I implemented physical forces and Verlet integration to simulate cloth dynamics. 
				The implementation includes external forces (like gravity), spring forces based on Hooke's law, 
				and position constraints to prevent excessive deformation. I experimented with different 
				simulation parameters to observe their effects on cloth behavior.
			</p>

			<h3>Spring Constant (ks)</h3>
			<p>
				The spring constant affects the stiffness of the cloth. With a low spring constant (ks = 10), 
				the cloth behaves more like a soft, droopy fabric such as silk. It stretches 
				significantly under its own weight and settles slowly with visible waves. With a high spring 
				constant (ks = 100000), the cloth behaves more like a stiff material such as canvas. 
				It maintains its shape better, shows less stretching, and settles quickly with minimal deformation.
			</p>

			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>
						<img src="part2_low_ks.png" width="400px"/>
						<figcaption>Low spring constant (ks = 10)</figcaption>
					</td>
					<td>
						<img src="part2_high_ks.png" width="400px"/>
						<figcaption>High spring constant (ks = 100000)</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<h3>Density</h3>
			<p>
				Density determines the mass of the cloth, affecting how it responds to forces. With a low density 
				(density = 5), the cloth behaves like a lightweight material. It settles quickly 
				and is more responsive to external forces like wind. With a high density (density = 1000), the cloth 
				behaves like a heavy material. It falls faster due to greater weight, 
				creates more pronounced folds, and is more resistant to movement once settled.
			</p>

			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>
						<img src="part2_low_density.png" width="400px"/>
						<figcaption>Low density (density = 5) - Lightweight behavior with gentle folds</figcaption>
					</td>
					<td>
						<img src="part2_high_density.png" width="400px"/>
						<figcaption>High density (density = 1000) - Heavy behavior with pronounced draping</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<h3>Damping</h3>
			<p>
				Damping controls how quickly the cloth loses energy during movement. With high damping (damping = 1%), 
				the cloth oscillates for a long time before coming to rest, similar to an elastic material with little 
				internal friction. With low damping (damping = 0.1%), the cloth quickly settles into position with 
				minimal bouncing, behaving more like a material with high internal friction.
			</p>

			<h3>Final Resting State</h3>
			<p>
				Below is the final resting state of the cloth from scene/pinned4.json. For this rendering, I used 
				the default parameters (ks = 5000, density = 15, damping = 0.2%).
			</p>

				<img src="part2_final_rest.png" alt="Final resting state of cloth" width="70%"/>
			</figure>

			<!-- Part 3 -->
			<h2>Part 3: Collisions</h2>
			<p>
				In this part, I implemented collision handling between the cloth and external objects like 
				spheres and planes. The implementation detects when point masses intersect with or cross 
				object boundaries and adjusts their positions accordingly to prevent penetration.
			</p>

			<h3>Collision Implementation</h3>
			<p>
				For sphere collisions, I check if a point mass is inside the sphere by comparing the distance 
				between the point mass and the sphere's center with the sphere's radius. If the point is inside, 
				I calculate a correction vector that moves the point to the sphere's surface along the line from 
				the sphere's center to the point. This correction is then applied to the point's position, scaled 
				by a friction factor to simulate the friction between the cloth and the sphere.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				For plane collisions, I detect when a point mass crosses from one side of the plane to the other 
				by checking the sign of the dot product between the point-to-plane vector and the plane's normal. 
				When a crossing is detected, I calculate the intersection point along the line segment from the 
				point's previous position to its current position, then place the point slightly above the plane 
				on the original side. Like with spheres, the correction is scaled by friction.
			</p>

			<h3>Sphere Collision with Different Spring Constants</h3>
			<p>
				The spring constant significantly affects how the cloth drapes over the sphere. Below are 
				results with three different spring constants:
			</p>

			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>
						<img src="part3_ks500_sphere.png" width="400px"/>
						<figcaption>Low spring constant (ks = 500)</figcaption>
					</td>
					<td>
						<img src="part3_ks5000_sphere.png" width="400px"/>
						<figcaption>Default spring constant (ks = 5000)</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td colspan="2">
						<img src="part3_ks50000_sphere.png" width="400px"/>
						<figcaption>High spring constant (ks = 50000)</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>
				With a low spring constant (ks = 500), the cloth is very soft and drapes closely around the sphere, 
				creating many folds and wrinkles as it conforms to the spherical shape. The cloth stretches significantly 
				under its own weight.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				With the default spring constant (ks = 5000), the cloth maintains some structure while still 
				adapting to the sphere's shape. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				With a high spring constant (ks = 50000), the cloth behaves like a stiff material, barely deforming 
				from its original shape. It touches the sphere but maintains a tent-like structure over it instead of 
				conforming to the sphere's contours.
			</p>

			<h3>Plane Collision</h3>
			<p>
				Below is the cloth at rest on a plane.

				<img src="part3_plane_rest.png" alt="Cloth at rest on a plane" width="70%"/>
				<figcaption>Cloth peacefully at rest on a plane with custom coloring</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<!-- Part 4 -->
			<h2>Part 4: Self-Collisions</h2>
			<p>
				In this part, I implemented self-collision detection and resolution for the cloth simulation. This allows the cloth 
				to interact with itself realistically when it folds, preventing different parts of the cloth from 
				passing through each other.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Self-Collision Implementation</h3>
			<p>
				My implementation uses spatial hashing to efficiently detect potential collisions between point masses. The system
				divides 3D space into grid cells and maps each point mass to a cell based on its position.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The implementation consists of three main components:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A hash function that maps a 3D position to a unique identifier representing a specific grid cell</li>
				<li>A spatial map that stores point masses organized by their grid cell</li>
				<li>A collision resolution function that detects when point masses are too close and calculates correction vectors</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				When point masses come within twice the cloth thickness of each other, a correction force is applied to push them apart.
				This ensures that the cloth maintains a minimum separation distance between different layers, creating realistic folds
				and preventing interpenetration.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Cloth Self-Collision Sequence</h3>
			<p>
				Below is a sequence showing how the cloth folds and collides with itself as it falls:
			</p>
			
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>
						<img src="part4_self_collision_early.png" width="400px"/>
						<figcaption>Early stage: Initial self-collision as the cloth begins to fold</figcaption>
					</td>
					<td>
						<img src="part4_self_collision_mid.png" width="400px"/>
						<figcaption>Middle stage: Multiple folds forming as the cloth continues to fall</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td colspan="2">
						<img src="part4_self_collision_rest.png" width="400px"/>
						<figcaption>Final stage: Cloth at relative rest with complex folds formed by self-collisions</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<h3>Effect of Varying Parameters on Self-Collisions</h3>
			<p>
				The simulation parameters significantly affect how the cloth behaves when colliding with itself:
			</p>
			
			<h4>Varying Spring Constant (ks)</h4>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>
						<img src="part4_low_ks_self.png" width="400px"/>
						<figcaption>Low spring constant (ks = 500)</figcaption>
					</td>
					<td>
						<img src="part4_high_ks_self.png" width="400px"/>
						<figcaption>High spring constant (ks = 50000)</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>
				With a low spring constant (ks = 500), the cloth creates many small, detailed folds when it collides with itself. 
				The fabric appears more fluid-like. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				With a high spring constant (ks = 50000), the cloth forms fewer, larger folds. It maintains its shape much more rigidly, 
				creating tent-like structures.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Varying Density</h4>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>
						<img src="part4_low_density_self.png" width="400px"/>
						<figcaption>Low density (density = 5)</figcaption>
					</td>
					<td>
						<img src="part4_high_density_self.png" width="400px"/>
						<figcaption>High density (density = 100)</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			

			<p>
				With low density (5), the cloth falls slowly and makes soft, wide folds that spread out more on the ground. It looks puffy and takes up more space, like a light scarf.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				With high density (100), the cloth falls quickly and makes tight, narrow folds that stay closer together. It makes a smaller, more compact pile with sharper creases, like a heavy blanket.
			</p>
