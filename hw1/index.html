		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>
			This project explores the fundamentals of rasterization. We start by drawing basic triangles
			efficiently, then step up to antialiasing by supersampling to smooth out jagged edges. We also learn about
			applying transforms (like translate, scale, and rotate) and use barycentric coordinates to interpolate
			attributes across triangles. Finally, we dive into texture mapping using different pixel sampling (nearest
			vs. bilinear) and mipmap-based level sampling (L_ZERO, L_NEAREST, L_LINEAR). Through these tasks, we see how
			each choice impacts performance, memory usage, and overall image quality.
		</p>

		<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
		<p>
			In this task, I implemented the <code>rasterize_triangle</code> function in <code>rasterizer.cpp</code> to
			render single-color triangles.
			The goal was to correctly fill pixels inside a given frame using rasterization techniques while ensuring
			that the algorithm remains efficient.
		</p>

		<h3>Algorithm Explanation</h3>
		<p>
			The triangle rasterization algorithm follows these steps:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>First, compute the <b>bounding box</b> of the triangle, which is the smallest rectangle that fully
				contains the triangle.</li>
			<li>Then, iterate over each pixel within this bounding box, checking whether the pixel's center (x + 0.5, y
				+ 0.5) is inside the triangle.</li>
			<li>To check if a pixel is inside the triangle, I used the <b>Point-in-Triangle Test</b>, which determines
				whether a point lies inside or outside based on the orientation of the triangle's edges.</li>
			<li>If the pixel is inside the triangle, I call <code>fill_pixel()</code> to color it.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Efficiency Justification</h3>
		<p>
			The algorithm is structured to be no worse than a naive approach that checks every pixel in the bounding
			box:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>By restricting checks to the bounding box, we limit unnecessary computations outside the triangle.</li>
			<li>Using the <b>edge function</b> eliminates the need for expensive floating-point division and ensures
				fast point-in-triangle checks.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Rendered Output</h3>
		<p>
			Below is a screenshot of <code>basic/test4.svg</code> rendered using my implementation.
		</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<h3>Extra Credit: Optimizations</h3>
		<p>
			To enhance performance, I optimized the edge function calculations by using incremental updates.
			Instead of recomputing the edge functions for each pixel separately, I used the method that moving from one
			pixel to the next along a scanline results in predictable changes.
			By updating the edge function values incrementally, I reduced repeated computations.

		<p>
			On average, the optimized implementation is approximately <b>4x to 7x faster</b> than the basic version.
		</p>

		<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
		<h3>Overview of Supersampling</h3>
		<p>
			Supersampling is a technique used to reduce aliasing by taking multiple samples within each pixel and
			averaging them.
			Instead of evaluating a single color per pixel, we divide each pixel into multiple subpixels, compute color
			values for each,
			and then average them to produce the final pixel color. This smooths out jagged edges and improves image
			quality.
		</p>

		<h3>Modifications to the Rasterization Pipeline</h3>
		<p>
			To implement supersampling, I modified the rasterization pipeline in the following ways:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Instead of writing directly to the framebuffer, I created a sample_buffer that stores multiple samples
				per pixel. The buffer size is dynamically updated based on the sample rate.</li>
			<li>In <code>rasterize_triangle()</code>, I sampled at <code>sqrt(sample_rate) x sqrt(sample_rate)</code>
				positions within each pixel instead of just at the center.</li>
			<li>After rasterizing all primitives, I averaged the subpixel colors in
				<code>resolve_to_framebuffer()</code> to compute the final pixel color before writing to the
				framebuffer.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>How Supersampling Reduces Aliasing</h3>
		<p>
			Aliasing occurs when high-frequency details are not sampled adequately, leading to jagged edges.
			Supersampling mitigates this by capturing more detail at a higher resolution and averaging the results,
			creating smoother transitions along triangle edges.
		</p>
		<h3>Comparison of Different Sample Rates</h3>
		<p>
			Below are screenshots of <code>basic/test4.svg</code> taken with different sample rates: 1, 4, and 16.
			The Pixel Inspector is positioned over the red thin triangle corner to highlight the differences.
		</p>

		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Sample Rate 1 (No Antialiasing)</th>
				<th>Sample Rate 4</th>
				<th>Sample Rate 16</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<img src="test4_sample1.png" alt="Sample Rate 1" width="300">
				</td>
				<td>
					<img src="test4_sample4.png" alt="Sample Rate 4" width="300">
				</td>
				<td>
					<img src="test4_sample16.png" alt="Sample Rate 16" width="300">
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<p>
			As the sample rate increases, the pixel colors blend more naturally along edges, reducing harsh transitions.
			This is because higher sample rates provide finer resolution during rasterization, leading to better color
			averaging in downsampling.
		</p>

		<h2>Task 3: Transforms</h2>
		<h3>Implementing Transformations</h3>
		<p>
			In this task, I implemented the translate, scale, and rotate matrix transformations in
			<code>transforms.cpp</code>.
			These transformations allow us to manipulate 2D objects in an SVG scene using homogeneous coordinates.
		</p>
		<h3>Screenshot of Robot</h3>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Default Robot</th>

					<img src="my_robot.png" alt="my_robot" width="300">
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>
			For my custom robot, I modified the arm positions to make it look like it is waving.
			I also adjusted the leg angles slightly to give it a more dynamic.
			Additionally, I changed the color of the body to purple to give it a fresh and unique look.
		</p>
		<h3>Extra Credit: Viewport Rotation</h3>
		<p>
			I added a feature to rotate the viewport using the Left (`←`) and Right (`→`) arrow keys.
			This works by applying a <b>rotation matrix</b> to the <b>SVG to NDC transformation</b> (`svg_to_ndc`).
		</p>
		<p>
			The rotation is implemented in <code>set_view()</code> by:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>First, translating the viewport center to the origin.</li>
			<li>Then, applying a rotation matrix based on <code>view_rotation</code>.</li>
			<li>Finally, translating back to the original center.</li>
		</ol>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Default Robot</th>
				<th>Custome Robot</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>

					<img src="rotation_viewpoint1.png" width="300">
				</td>
				<td>
					<img src="rotation_viewpoint2.png" width="300">
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
		<h3>Understanding Barycentric Coordinates</h3>
		<p>
			Barycentric coordinates describe a way to locate a point inside a triangle by using three numbers (α, β, γ)
			that act like weights for the triangle’s corners.
			Each number shows how much influence a particular corner has on the point’s position.
			The key rule is that these three weights always add up to 1, making it easy to understand how the point is
			placed within the triangle.
		</p>

		<p>
			If a point is closer to a vertex, that vertex has a higher weight in the interpolation.
			This allows smooth transitions between vertex attributes, like color or texture coordinates.
		</p>

		<p>
			Below is an illustration showing how the weights change inside a triangle:

		<h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>
		<h3>Pixel Sampling and Texture Mapping</h3>
		<p>
			Pixel sampling is the process of determining a color for a pixel based on a texture image. Instead of
			assigning colors directly to pixels, we use texture coordinates (u, v) mapped to a texture. We need to fetch
			the appropriate color from the texture image, as textures are often smaller or larger than the actual object
			being rendered.

			In this implementation, each triangle vertex has a texture coordinate, which is interpolated across the
			triangle using barycentric interpolation. For each pixel inside the triangle, the interpolated (u, v) is
			used to sample the texture. The sampling method determines how the texture image is accessed and how colors
			are retrieved.
		</p>

		<h3>Nearest vs. Bilinear Sampling</h3>
		<p>
			Nearest-neighbor sampling selects the color of the texel closest to the given (u, v) coordinate. This is
			simple and fast but often results in blocky artifacts, especially when enlarging a texture.
		</p>
		<p>
			Bilinear sampling, on the other hand, considers the four texels surrounding the (u, v) coordinate and
			performs a weighted average. This results in smoother transitions between texels, reducing blocky artifacts
			and providing a more visually appealing result.
		</p>
		<h3>Comparison of Sampling Methods</h3>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>Nearest Sampling (1 sample per pixel)</td>
				<td>Nearest Sampling (16 samples per pixel)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="nearest_1spp.png" width="400"></td>
				<td><img src="nearest_16spp.png" width="400"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Bilinear Sampling (1 sample per pixel)</td>
				<td>Bilinear Sampling (16 samples per pixel)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="bilinear_1spp.png" width="400"></td>
				<td><img src="bilinear_16spp.png" width="400"></td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<h3>Observations and Differences</h3>
		<p>
			When we use <b>nearest sampling</b> with just one sample per pixel, we often see crisp but sometimes jagged
			edges around individual texels. Increasing the sample rate to 16 sub-samples per pixel does help a bit, but
			it can still leave noticeable aliasing in areas where the texture is zoomed in.
		</p>
		<p>
			Meanwhile, <b>bilinear sampling</b> blends neighboring texels, which softens harsh boundaries. Even at one
			sample per pixel, bilinear filtering already looks smoother than nearest sampling in many spots. And if we
			combine bilinear filtering with a higher sample rate like 16 sub-samples per pixel, we usually get an even
			cleaner result with fewer jagged edges.
		</p>
		<p>
			The contrast between nearest and bilinear sampling is most apparent when the texture is low-resolution or
			stretched significantly. Nearest sampling can produce blocky patches and pixelation, whereas bilinear
			sampling tends to create more natural-looking transitions by averaging texel colors.
		</p>

		<h2>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
		<p>
			Level sampling involves automatically choosing the correct mipmap for the texture. When viewing a texture
			from far away, a lower-resolution version (higher mipmap level) can make the image smoother and faster to
			render, because it reduces unintended aliasing.
		</p>

		<p>
			I implemented three modes for level selection:
		<ul>
			<li><b>L_ZERO:</b> Always sample from the base level (the original, full-resolution texture). This is
				fast but can look too detailed and aliased when the object is far away.
			</li>
			<li><b>L_NEAREST:</b> Compute which mipmap level is best and pick the closest. This is simpler but can
				have small jumps when the chosen level changes.
			</li>
			<li><b>L_LINEAR:</b> Compute a fractional level and blend between the two nearest mip levels, creating
				smoother transitions as the camera zooms in or out.
			</li>
		</ul>
		Either way, once I pick a mip level, I still use either nearest or bilinear pixel sampling (so there's also
		a combination like "trilinear" if we do L_LINEAR plus P_LINEAR).
		</p>

		<p>
			This helps reduce flickering and shimmering in textures when we zoom out, because the texture details
			aren't oversampled. Zooming in also works better because the correct higher-resolution or blended level is
			chosen.
		</p>

		<h3>Tradeoffs: Speed, Memory, and Antialiasing</h3>
		<p>
			When we have many mip levels, we use more memory overall. However, we save time because sampling from a
			smaller mip when we're zoomed out is faster. Also, it looks better because there is less aliasing or
			"moire" artifacts. But if we only used the base level (L_ZERO), we don’t store any extra mipmaps, so
			we 'd save memory but get more aliasing. So there's a give-and-take among speed, memory usage, and image
			quality.
		</p>

		<h3>Examples of Different Level and Pixel Sampling Methods</h3>
		<p>
			Having four combos is fun to compare:
		</p>

		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>L_ZERO + P_NEAREST</th>
				<th>Detail</th>
				<th>L_ZERO + P_LINEAR</th>
				<th>Detail</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="lz_pn.png" alt="L_ZERO, P_NEAREST" width="400"></td>
				<td><img src="lz_pn_detail.png" alt="L_ZERO, P_NEAREST, Detail" width="400"></td>

				<td><img src="lz_pl.png" alt="L_ZERO, P_LINEAR" width="400"></td>
				<td><img src="lz_pl_detail.png" alt="L_ZERO, P_NEAREST, Detail" width="400"></td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>L_NEAREST + P_NEAREST</th>
				<th>Detail</th>
				<th>L_NEAREST + P_LINEAR</th>
				<th>Detail</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="ln_pn.png" alt="L_NEAREST, P_NEAREST" width="400"></td>
				<td><img src="ln_pn_detail.png" alt="L_ZERO, P_NEAREST, Detail" width="400"></td>
				<td><img src="ln_pl.png" alt="L_NEAREST, P_LINEAR" width="400"></td>
				<td><img src="ln_pl_detail.png" alt="L_ZERO, P_NEAREST, Detail" width="400"></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>
			When we use <b>L_ZERO</b>, we ignore our mipmaps and always fetch from the highest-resolution texture. That
			can look okay if you're close, but when you zoom out, you often see flickering because the
			details are too high-res for the screen pixels.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li><b>P_NEAREST</b> on top of that means we pick just one texel closest to our (u,v) coordinate. So this
				tends to look aliasing.</li>
			<li><b>P_LINEAR</b> (bilinear) at least blends nearby texels, so it helps reduce some of that blockiness.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			<b>L_NEAREST</b> means we use the mipmap level that's closest to our needed resolution. That already
			cuts down on high-frequency detail that might cause flicker, because we're sampling from a texture that
			better matches the size of the shape on screen.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li><b>P_NEAREST</b> still picks just one texel in that chosen mip level. You can still get blocky edges and
				aliasing, because at each lookup, we pick the nearest texel in that mip level.</li>
			<li><b>P_LINEAR</b> again paints a smoother transition, because we average together the four nearest texels
				in that mip level, making edges appear softer and less blocky.</li>
		</ul>
